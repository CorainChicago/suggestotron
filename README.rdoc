This is an exercise from RailsBridge I completed and deployed with Heroku to https://tranquil-citadel-2006.herokuapp.com/topics/new. The exercise has clear instructions to cover creating, modifying, and deploying the app.  

Thanks RailsBridge for the exercise!  

Here are the instructions:  http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/

Happy Coding,
Cora
